    <!-- SITE NAME -->
    <section>
      <h2>Site Name</h2>

      <img src="images/piano-logo.png" alt="In‑Home Piano Lessons logo" class="logo">

      <p><strong>At‑Home Piano Lessons</strong></p>
      <p>
        I chose this name because it immediately tells visitors what the service is: piano lessons
        taught in the student’s home. It’s straightforward, easy to remember, and feels like something
        a parent or beginner would quickly understand when searching online. This project is also
        based on real lessons my wife teaches, so the name fits the actual service.
      </p>

    <!-- SITE PURPOSE -->
    <section>
      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The main purpose of this website is to help potential students (and parents) understand what
        in‑home piano lessons involve and what they can expect. The site will explain lesson options
        for different skill levels, share basic practice guidance to support progress, and provide an
        easy way to contact the instructor for questions or scheduling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I want the site to feel welcoming and helpful—especially for beginners who might feel
        unsure about where to start.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SCENARIOS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Scenarios (User Questions)</h2>
      <p>
        These are examples of questions I expect visitors to have when they land on the site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“I’ve never played piano before—what lesson level should I start with?”</li>
        <li>“How do I contact the instructor and get started with in‑home lessons?”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- COLOR SCHEME -->
    <section>
      <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
      <p>
        I chose a simple color palette that feels clean, calm, and easy to read. The blue works well
        for important actions like buttons and links, and the light gray helps sections feel organized
        without being distracting.
      </p>

      <div class="color-samples">
        <div class="color-box brand">
          <p>
            <strong>Brand Blue</strong><br>
            #1e88e5<br>
            Used for buttons, links, headings, and accents
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="color-box surface">
          <p>
            <strong>Soft Surface Gray</strong><br>
            #f6f8fb<br>
            Used for backgrounds, section panels, and cards
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- TYPOGRAPHY -->
    <section>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>
        The site will use a clean system font stack so it loads fast and stays readable across devices.
        This also keeps the design consistent and simple.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Headings:</strong> system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif</li>
        <li><strong>Body Text:</strong> system-ui, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WIREFRAMES -->
    <section>
      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        These wireframes show the basic layout plan for the home page on both mobile and desktop.
        They are meant to show structure (where things go), not final colors or detailed content.
      </p>
